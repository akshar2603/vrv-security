here i have used local storage for authorization and give role specific component from front end 
and use backend as database operation redirect user role and token to the front end. 

here must important thing is that logout must be required after and after authorisation works perfect and also then and then your token will be deleted and get store new user token. 
otherwise when you again visit link it will show previous session that i have done with local storage token checking at base url localhost:3000 .
